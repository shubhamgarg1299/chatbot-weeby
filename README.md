# chatbot-weeby
Chatbot Weeby is a chatbot created using azure services namely AI, ML, Cognitive services, web app services, chatbot services. These services is used to study the database which is created (in my case provided from microsoft website-FAQ section) to understand the questions and the queries that can be asked by the customers. The main advantage is that due to the use of AI, ML and Cognitive services, this bot can understand the query even if it is not in the proper language. While chatting with weeby, the user/customer feels like talking to a real person. Also these queries can be edited and improved while creating the knowledge base as well.
